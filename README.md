# HaskHell-Overengineering-101

Obligatory Haskell Project: Deciphering Confusion 🌀
Welcome to my maze of Haskell wonder. If you're on a quest to untangle some Haskell, unravel encryption methods, and embrace a delightful state of befuddlement, you've come to the right repository!

🤨 What's This All About?
To be candid, I'm still on that discovery journey myself. This repository is home to various Haskell files and additional resources that pivot around... something cryptic (pun intended). It's my hope that you, wise traveler, can unearth the deeper intent behind this project.

📜 Modules & Files:
1. Oblig0.hs
Our central module. It holds the keys to:

Encoding and decoding text with a specified key.
Counting the frequencies of individual characters.
Crafting Caesar cipher keys.
Importing frequency tables from an external file.
Hypothesizing keys based on observed character frequencies.
Conducting the Chi-squared test.
Applying a greedy approach to decryption.
2. assignment.pdf
The ancient manuscript that might, just might, clarify the genesis of this project.

3. Text files
corpus.txt: The revered corpus of our journey.
dictionary.txt: A cryptanalyst's trusty sidekick.

⚠️ A Gentle Reminder:
Not all functions operate flawlessly—consider them a "best attempt." If you find yourself as puzzled (or more) than I am, then you're on the right track. Join in on the Haskell escapade, and may your journey be as enlightening as it is confusing! 🌌🔍
